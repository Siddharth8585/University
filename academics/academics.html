            fields.

            Our curriculum emphasizes learning, creativity, innovation and collaboration with a program of liberal arts
            in the humanities, arts, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. You will explore many
            disciplines and also develop a deep understanding in one area of concentration.

            From admission to commencement, the undergraduate academic experience is overseen by the Office of the Dean
            of the College, fostering your intellectual engagement and growth every step along the way.

            <h1>Developing Your Skills</h1> <br>
            Independent research is a defining feature of a Victoria education. Most students finish their Victoria
            career doing original research as part of a major capstone project: an undergraduate senior thesis or a
            graduate dissertation. Here are some of the resources that help students get there.<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li> <u>Freshman seminars</u> for undergraduates provide the opportunity to work closely with a
                    professor and a small group of students on a topic of special interest.
                    Writing seminars(Link is external) prepare undergraduates for the rigors of academic research and
                    writing.</li><br>
                <li><u>The Office of Undergraduate Research</u> supports the undergraduate research experience as an
                    integral part of a Victoria education, whether it be taking a research-based class, conducting
                    research in the lab, pursuing independent research beyond campus, or completing your senior thesis.
                </li><br>
                <li><u>The Writing Center</u> offers free one-on-one sessions with experienced writers trained to
                    consult on projects in any discipline. Writing Center fellows can assist undergraduate and graduate
                    students at any stage of the writing process, and the center also holds events like boot camps for
                    senior thesis and dissertation writing.</li><br>
                <li><u>The McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning</u> helps undergraduates learn advanced strategies to
                    succeed in their academic work and improve their study skills. Programs for graduate students and
                    postdoctoral scholars help them develop as scholars and teachers. </li>

            <h1>Liberal Arts</h1> <br>
            Victoria is unique in being a great research university with a profound commitment to the liberal arts. We
            provide a liberal arts education to all undergraduates, broadening their outlooks, and helping form their
            characters and values. We encourage students to explore ideas and methods across the humanities, arts,
            natural sciences, engineering and social sciences. When you graduate from Princeton, you will be prepared
            for whatever path and passions you choose in life.
